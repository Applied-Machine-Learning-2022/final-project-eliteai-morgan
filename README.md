## Description
The project goal is to use the the fibonnaci sequence in a reccurent neural network to find the aproximation of the following numbers in the sequence. We are using the fibonnaci sequence in a recurrent neural network to find the most accurate representation of the data. The sequence is used as a mathmatical metaphor to see the bias and fairness that is used in todays times aswell as how it impacts peoples lives. The tools that we use to accomplish this task is the golden rule which is a quadratic formula that we implented to teach the network a pattern. In which it accomplises a divider for fairness. We are also using linear regression as a tool that will give us an exact reprosentation of where the data needs to be so we know where our recurrent nerual network needs to be.
