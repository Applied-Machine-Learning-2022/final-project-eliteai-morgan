## Description
The project goal is to use the the fibonnaci sequence in a reccurent neural network to find the aproximation of the following numbers in the sequence. We are using the fibonnaci sequence in a recurrent neural network to find the most accurate representation of the data. The sequence is used as a mathmatical metaphor to see the bias and fairness that is used in todays times aswell as how it impacts peoples lives. The tools that we use to accomplish this task is the golden rule which is a quadratic formula that we implented to teach the network a pattern. In which it accomplises a divider for fairness. We are also using linear regression as a tool that will give us an exact reprosentation of where the data needs to be so we know where our recurrent nerual network needs to be.

## Fibonacci's sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers, in his attempt to discover how many rabbits can be produced from a single pair of rabbits in one year under ideal conditions.

The mathmatical formula for the Fibonacci sequence is Xn= Xn-1+Xn-2

## What is valuable about this structure

## Our Goals for this project
Our goals for this project is to build the most accurate and effective recurrent neural network with the intent to teach the model the fibonacci sequence and construct a recurring neural network model to predict Fibonacci's sequence based on a predetermined sequence of data.

-->
1. Build a model that will be able to train a sequence of numbers
2. Test a sequence to see how accurate and efficient the model is
3. Build another model that will be able to train a sequence of numbers
4. Test a sequence to see how accurate and efficient the new model is
5. Compare and contrast the two models and build a third model with different hyperperameters that we we received from thhe previous models
6. Determine the most accurate
