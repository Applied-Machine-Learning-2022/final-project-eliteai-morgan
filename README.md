## Description
The project goal is to use Fibonnaci's sequence in a reccurent neural network to find the aproximation of the following numbers in the sequence. We are using the fibonnaci sequence in a recurrent neural network to find the most accurate representation of the data. The sequence is used as a mathmatical metaphor to see the bias and fairness that is used in todays times aswell as how it impacts peoples lives. The tools that we use to accomplish this task is the golden rule which is a quadratic formula that we implented to teach the network a pattern. In which it accomplises a divider for fairness. We are also using linear regression as a tool that will give us an exact reprosentation of where the data needs to be so we know where our recurrent nerual network needs to be.

## Fibonacci's sequence
Fibonacci’s sequence is the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, in his attempt to discover how many rabbits can be produced from a single pair of rabbits in one year under ideal conditions. The mathematical formula for Fibonacci’s sequence is Xn= Xn-1+Xn-2

## What is valuable about this structure
The main thing that is valuable being able to take the recurrent neural network train it to understand a pattern and take that understanding to make accurate prediction

## Our Goals for this project
Our goals for this project is to build the most accurate and effective recurrent neural network with the intent to teach the model the Fibonacci’s sequence and construct a recurring neural network model to predict Fibonacci's sequence based on a predetermined sequence of data.

## Models
Using a Recurrent neural network, we measure the accuracy of prediction of the next numbers of the Fibonacci’s sequence. We then build a different model by using more of a LSTM (Long short-term memory) with control over the learning rate and Decay rate. Then based on these two models we build off those with additional models that we tweak to test if we get closer and more accurate results.

Give details on how to install fork and install your project. You can get all of the python dependencies for your project by typing `pip3 freeze requirements.txt` on the system that runs your project. Add the generated `requirements.txt` to this repo.
-->
1.	Build a model that will be able to train a sequence of numbers
2.	Test a sequence to see how accurate and efficient the model is
3.	Build another model that will be able to train a sequence of numbers
4.	Test a sequence to see how accurate and efficient the new model is
5.	Compare and contrast the two models and build a third model with different hyperparameters that we received from the previous models
6.	Determine the most accurate
